# Network

Ãª The network settings made via the serial panel are volatile, i.e. they are
reset to Default settings following a reboot of the SMS Gateway.

i You can save the network settings permanently in the web interface of the
SMS Gateway under **Configuration - Network**.

## DHCP- or Static-Server

Select a mode:  
  
**DHCP** \- If you have a DHCP server, it will automatically assign an IP
address to your SMS Gateway. No further settings will be necessary. Save your
settings.

**Static** \- If you wish to determine an IP address yourself, enter it and a
suitable sub-network mask in the intended fields. Enter a Standard gateway.
Enter at least one DNS server. Save your settings.
