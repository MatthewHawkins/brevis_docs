<p>Important stability update for the new DX and RX editions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With firmware versions prior to 21.09, these models may experience a sporadic loss of transmit power, which could only be resolved by manual restart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore we recommend all customers of the DX and RX models to update to 21.09 to prevent this problem.</p>
