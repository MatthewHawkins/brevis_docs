## 1\. Insert the SIM card

Ãª IMPORTANT: Before inserting the SIM card, please remove the PIN from the SIM
card and disconnect the gateway from the power. Here you should wait 2 minutes
until the capacitors have discharged and you insert the SIM card. This also
applies if you change the SIM card! Check whether the SIM is correctly
engaged. A clicking noise must be audible.

  * Insert the SIM card (Standard SIM).

## 2\. Screw the antenna

  * Screw the antenna to the SMA connector.

## 3\. Connect the network cable

  * Connect an RJ-45 network cable. Please use the Ethernet Port.

## 4\. Connect the Power cable

  * Connect the power cable to the device. The power indicator will now light up.

## 5\. Network configuration

  * If your network has a DHCP server, it can issue an IP address to the brevis.one SMS Gateway.

  * If no DHCP is available, the device will start with the standard IP 192.168.1.1.

  * If you do not know the IP address assigned by the DHCP, you have the option of requesting it via the serial port.

  * For this purpose, connect your PC using a terminal program (e.g. PuTTY) and the port cable with the Gateway.

  * The speed of the interface here is 115200 baud (8N1).

  * Klick the _open_ button and type _Enter_.

  * A text-based interface appears in which the current IP address is shown under the Version menu option.

  * The IP address can be altered as you wish under the Network menu option.

  * If you make the network settings using the serial port, they will only be temporary and will be lost when the Gateway is restarted.

  * Permanent network settings should be made in the web interface.

  * You can now access the web interface via the IP address.   
Log in here with the following information:  
user name: **admin**  
password: **admin**

## 6\. Licensing

  * After logging into the web interface, you must request a licence for your Gateway. As long as this process has not been completed you will constantly be requested to do so after logging in.
