### Shipping options

The webinterface offers 3 different shipping options. Telegram, SMS and
Automatic.

  * **Telegram** delivers a message via Telegram.
  * **SMS** delivers a text message.
  * **Automatic** trys to deliver the message via Telegram, if it fails the message will be delivered by text message.

ê Licensing for the Telegram module is required. This licensing is free of
charge for support customers. Please contact sales@brevis.one.

### SMS Type

The webinterface offers different SMS Types:

  * **Standard SMS:** Standard SMS Message.

  * **Flash SMS:** The message appears directly on the recipients phone display and it is not stored when dismissed. Flash messages are useful during emergency situations.

  * **Ring:** instead of sending a SMS, a voice call will be made, but when the recipient picks up the call, nothing will be heard. Note that voice calls might not be supported by your modem. Ring messages are useful during emergency situations

ê The functions "Ring" and "Flash SMS" are only usable with newer versions
(from purchase date 2021) of the SMS Gateway. With a SIM card, which only
includes the sending of SMS, our "Ring" function does not work!
